-----------------
  How to Use
-----------------

Use the included flips.exe program to patch BBN3_pve.bps over a clean BN3 Blue ROM.
It must be the Blue version of BN3 (English).


There are two versions of the BBN3 SinglePlayer patch:

"BBN3_pve.bps" is compatible with the Open Mode patch. Must apply this patch first, then Open Mode second. This version IS NOT compatible with the randomizer. Use this version if you don't intend to use the randomizer.


"bbn3_pve_randomize.bps" IS compatible with the randomizer. It contains none of BBN3's text edits. You can also use it with the Open Mode patch. To apply all 3 patches, patch with BBN3 first, then Open Mode second, then apply the randomizer last.

The randomizer and the "Open Mode patch" in question can be found here:

Main differences in the BBN3 SinglePlayer version:


All standard chips are limited to 4 per folder (this is vanilla behavior).

None of the chips or PAs are disabled.

Chips have vanilla damage values, except for Muramasa and Poltergeist.

The ModTools Error/EX Codes have vanilla behavior.

Friendly viruses have vanilla behavior.

After receiving the Press NCP from Cossak, Press will become permanently applied the next time you run the customizer.

The Energychange NCP is always applied automatically.

BlackMind and Alpha are not applied automatically.

Custom and Team Style do not have buffed stats.

When starting a new save, the Mistman chips will be added to your library.

The tutorial is skipped at game start. You're welcome.

The ElemBody NCPs work normally, but they also set your next style's element to their respective element. 
If the navicust is ran without an ElemBody NCP, your next style's element will be rerolled.
