	BBN3 Spanish Singleplayer

"BBN3_pve_Spanish" is the Singleplayer version of BBN3. It contains a lot of the improvements to the battle engine, and some unique QoL improvements just for Singleplayer. None of the "pvp-exclusive" features in the changelog are present in this version of BBN3.

  How to Use
-----------------

Use the included flips.exe program to patch BBN3_pve_Spanish.bps over a clean BN3 Blue ROM.
It must be the Blue version of BN3 (English).


Be aware: the Spanish translation patch is not compatible with the BN3 Randomizer.

"bbn3_pve_randomize.bps" is compatible with the randomizer. It contains none of BBN3's text edits, which unfortunately means that it does not include Spanish translations.
