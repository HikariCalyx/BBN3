# Experimental BBN3 Netplay

For anyone stumbling in on this, please be patient. This is not in a playable state yet.


bbn3_netplay.lua goes in the "\BizHawk-2.5.2\Lua" folder when you're ready to test it

BBN3.gba goes in the "\BizHawk-2.5.2\BBN3" folder

There are two batch files for quickly launching the netplay script. To use "load double netplay.bat", make a second copy of the "BBN3.gba" rom and rename it to "BBN3p2.gba"
