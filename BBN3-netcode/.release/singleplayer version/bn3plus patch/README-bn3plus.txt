This patch is entirely optional. 
Note that it will cause certain menus and animations to take longer to load.

This is a modified version of Prof9's BN3Plus patch, which was not natively compatible with BBN3.

This patch contains the extra Navi Customizer and Jack In animations from the EXE version.

Apply this patch over a rom that has already had BBN3_pve.bps applied.
